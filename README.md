# Art Inspiration Gallery

## Project Description
This project is a part of my web interaction course and web scripting 2 reflects my passion for art, particularly the profound influence of Japanese art on the Impressionist movement in the 19th century. The website provides an interactive digital gallery that showcases famous works by Impressionist artists like Monet and Van Gogh alongside traditional Japanese ukiyo-e prints. By exploring these artworks, users can observe similarities in the use of color and perspective. 

The core feature of the project is an API-integrated(Unsplash) search functionality that allows users to find art inspirations and save their favorite pieces to a personal board. The initial search term is set to "Japanese," creating a cohesive experience with the home page and evoking the feelings of Western artists when they first encountered Japanese art.

## Challenges Faced

### 1. **Understanding and Integrating the Unsplash API**
   - **Challenge**: The API documentation was a bit difficult to understand, especially I haven't really experienced the integration all by mysel yet,
   - **Solution**: Broke down the documentation into manageable parts, focusing on essential features first and gradually adding functionality like pagination and saving favorites.

### 2. **Design and Layout**
   - **Challenge**:Creating a visually appealing and cohesive layout that balances functionality and artistic appeal.
   - **Solution**: Iterated through from figma file wireframe , tested them with the API data, and adjusted styles to achieve the desired look and feel.

## Reflection
This project allowed me to merge my core passion for art with web development.
I liked the idea that not only educates users about the artistic connections between Impressionism and Japanese art 
but also empowers them to explore their inspirations interactively. 
Overcoming the challenges of API integration and layout design enhanced my skills and deepened my appreciation for both art and coding.
