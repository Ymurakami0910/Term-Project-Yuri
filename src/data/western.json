His fascination with Japanese art is evident in his use of bold colors, distinct brushwork, and asymmetrical compositions. Works like 'The Courtesan' and 'The Flowering Plum Tree' reflect his admiration for Japanese aesthetics, particularly the emphasis on nature and the stylized portrayal of subjects."

This can be seen in the linearity and emotional intensity of his works, which echo some aspects of Japanese woodblock prints."

He was greatly influenced by Japanese prints, particularly in his approach to composition, use of color, and the overall aesthetic of simplicity and minimalism. His 'Nocturne' series, with its moody, atmospheric qualities, can be seen as influenced by the Japanese appreciation for subtlety and the beauty of fleeting moments."
